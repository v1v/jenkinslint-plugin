Jenkins.Lint.Title               =  Jenkins Lint
Jenkins.Lint.Description         =  The <a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Lint+Plugin">Jenkins Lint Plugin</a> has mainly two goals:
Jenkins.Lint.Description.1       =  <li>To make it easier to detect issues in your Jenkins configuration that will cause Jenkins to blow up when you attempt to run those jobs.</li>
Jenkins.Lint.Description.2       =  <li>To encourage discussion within the Jenkins community on the more subjective stuff. Having a set of checks to base discussion on helps drive out what we as a community think is good style.</li>
